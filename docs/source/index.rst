The AWS Cloud-Computing Web Framework
=====================================

botoweb is an **Application Framework** for highly scalable application servers. It uses the standard `Three-Tier <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture#Three-tier_architecture>`_ architecture to be housed in the `Amazon Web Services <http://aws.amazon.com/>`_ environment. It uses boto_ for communication with these services (hence the name, botoweb).
